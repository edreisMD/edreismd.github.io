I'm a radiologist turned an AI researcher.

Currently I'm a visiting scholar at Stanford AIMI Center, working in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Medicine.

I love working in AI! My ultimate purpose is to significantly contribute to the “discovery” of intelligence (even if I can just be an example of a rational being). Our best chance to understand intelligence is by creating AGI. Lets work together as a society to do that in a way that we will not regret.
